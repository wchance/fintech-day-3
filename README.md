# Fintech Day 3
This is my Fintech day 3 class work

I am William Chance an entreprenuer with a good technical background.   I have started my own Telecommunications company and was one of the first adopters of VoIP in the market.   It has been 21 years now working on my own. In last year and half I have transitioned to focus in fintech because one of my customer needed to resolve issues that hinder them to grow in accepting cryptocurrencies.

My goal is to become a Billing and Payments service provider to help companies with Deposits and Withdrawls to above errors and pay to correct fees.

I choose this because I was stuck in telecom and needed a change because I was not going to survive in the path I was going.
